(Ethernet) If there are too many devices on one cable, speed slows way down because of too many collisions when everyone is trying to Transfer and Receive at the same time. 
So we use a switch with many ports/jacks. Make the switch smart by Learning the MAC address of each device so when info comes in, there is no need to transfer the info to 
every jack. Only transfer to the correct jack with the correct MAC address corresponding to the MAC address attached to the message being Transferred/Received. 
This “intelligence” is what makes a switch different from a hub. Then inside the switch is a Mesh system of connections (so each port is connected to every other port). 
The functional rule we use here is: CSMA/CD: Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (Which really isn’t needed in a switch but is needed in a hub…)

Twisted Pair, coax, fiber can all be ethernet ONCE ITS PLUGGED INTO switch or connected to the Network Card but before that they are just cables.

Seven Parts of an Ethernet Frame
Preamble: 64 bit information telling the receiving NIC that a frame is coming and where the frame starts
Destination MAC: 6 bytes
Source MAC: 6 bytes
Type: 2 bytes
Data: 46 - 1500 Bytes
Pad (part of the data, needed only if the real data is less than 46 bytes because if it is less than 46 bytes, the system will consider it a crash or collision and not real data. Basically, the system thinks it is a mistake. A padding is added to meet the 46 byte minimum.)
FCS: 4 bytes
